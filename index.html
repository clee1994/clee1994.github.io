<p>My doctoral advisor is <a href="https://siddharth-joshi.com/">Dr Siddharth Joshi</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests focus on brain-inspired computing. Especially applying findings from neuroscience to topics in machine learning, this ranges from using biologically plausible spiking dynamics on a single neuron level to stochasticity in synapsis to hyperdimensional computing. The overall goal is to find new ways for computers to learn more efficiently. In the future, my goal is to partake in the development of cutting-edge brain-inspired computing hardware and algorithms. I obtained an undergrad degree in Business Administration (specialisation in Economics) from the <a href="https://www.ku.de/en/faculty-of-business-administration-wfi/">Catholic University Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt</a> and a Masters in Computational Finance from the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, during that time I was a scholarship holder of the <a href="https://www.freiheit.org/">Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom</a>.</p>
