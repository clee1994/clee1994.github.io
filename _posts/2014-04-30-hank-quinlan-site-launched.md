Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

$$u_{n+1} = u_n - \frac{\Delta_t}{\tau_m} (u_n - u_{res}) + \frac{\Delta_t\Delta_T}{\tau_m} \exp{(\frac{u_n- \vartheta_{RH}}{\Delta_T})}- \frac{\Delta_t}{\tau_m}Rw_n +  \frac{\Delta_t}{\tau_m} RI(t)$$

$$w_{n+1} = w_n + \frac{a\Delta_t}{\tau_w} (w_n-u_{res}) - \frac{\Delta_t}{\tau_w}w+ \Delta_t b \sum_{t^f} \delta(t-t^f)$$
