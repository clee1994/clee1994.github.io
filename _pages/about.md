My name is Clemens JS Schaefer and I am a 5th year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My doctoral advisor is [Dr Siddharth Joshi](https://siddharth-joshi.com/). The last two summers (2021 and 2022) I interned at Google LLC in the Core ML team and the ASML team both times working on quantization.

My research interest focuses on quantization of deep neural networks and brain-inspired computing. In particular on enhancing the energy-efficiency of training and deploying neural network (NN) models using hardware aware quantization as well neuroscience-inspired algorithms (e.g. spiking neural networks). 

I obtained an undergrad degree in Business Administration (specialisation in Economics) from the [Catholic University Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt](https://www.ku.de/en/faculty-of-business-administration-wfi/) and a Masters in Computational Finance from the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), during that time I was a scholarship holder of the [Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom](https://www.freiheit.org/). For more details refer to my [CV](files/CV.pdf).
