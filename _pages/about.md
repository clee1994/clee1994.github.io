My name is Clemens JS Schaefer and I am a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My doctoral advisor is [Dr Siddharth Joshi](https://siddharth-joshi.com/). Last summer (2021) I interned at Google LLC in the [QKeras](https://github.com/google/qkeras) and ASML Team.

My research interest focuses on brain-inspired computing. In particular on enhancing the energy-efficiency of training and deploying neural network (NN) models using neuroscience-inspired algorithms, which improve NN’s suitability to low-precision operation and parallelization. My goal is to find new ways for computers to learn more efficiently by developing cutting-edge brain-inspired computing hardware and algorithms.

I obtained an undergrad degree in Business Administration (specialisation in Economics) from the [Catholic University Eichstätt-Ingolstadt](https://www.ku.de/en/faculty-of-business-administration-wfi/) and a Masters in Computational Finance from the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), during that time I was a scholarship holder of the [Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom](https://www.freiheit.org/).
